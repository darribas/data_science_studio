## Delivery modes

The course is delivered following a flipped, hybrid model by which some of the content is available to students *before* class time, and some is delivered in group sessions together with the instructor. The former is called *asynchronous* delivery, while the latter is referred to as *synchronous*.

Throughout the course content, each learning object (typically subsections in the materials) is tagged with one of the following two labels for reference:

- 💻 `[Async]` To be completed asynchronously, on your own, and *before* class
- 👨‍🏫 `[Sync]` To be completed synchronously, with course instructor, remotely through video link

Similarly, the overview below contains them for a quick, general sense at what is expected from you before we meet in synchronous sessions.
