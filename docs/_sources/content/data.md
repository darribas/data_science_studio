# Data

## *What*

To maintain consistency and allow you to focus on the concepts we will be exploring throughout this course, we will stick to the same data throughout.

## Source

The dataset we will use comes from [InsideAirBnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) and contains real estate properties listed for the area of Paris (France). Essentially every bit of information you can inquire about an AirBnb property is recorded in the original dataset. From there, we have processed it to simplify it so it is easier to illustrates the concepts we will be learning in the course.

## Access

All the data files required for this course is contained in the zip compressed {ref}`bundled download <github_repo>` provided via Github.

## Prep code

Data preparation code is available, if you are so inclined, for you to peruse over [here](data/data_prep).
